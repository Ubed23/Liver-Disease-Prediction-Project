A Liver Disease Prediction System is a classification project designed to predict the likelihood of liver-related conditions based on specific input variables. Here's a brief overview:

Objective
The goal is to classify patients into categories such as:

No disease
Suspect disease
Hepatitis C
Fibrosis
Cirrhosis
Data Set Details
Total instances: 615 (rows)
Features: 13 (columns), mainly numeric, with one binary variable (Sex).
Features include clinical measures like:
Albumin: Indicates liver/kidney disease if below the normal range.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Elevated levels suggest liver damage.
ALT/AST enzymes: Indicate liver damage or disease when elevated.
Bilirubin: High levels signal liver damage.
Other markers: Cholesterol, Creatinine, GGT, Cholinesterase, Protein, etc.
Process
Kick-off & Objective Discussion: Establish goals and understand the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand patterns, clean data, and visualize insights.
Model Building: Train and test classification models for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance metrics like accuracy and recall.
Deployment: Deploy the system using tools like Streamlit.
Presentation: Showcase results and insights in the final presentation.
